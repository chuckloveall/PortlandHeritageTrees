Controlled burns were used to maintain oak savannah for promoting growth of food staples such as camas, berries, and acorns and minimizing competition of conifers and shrubs that would compete with Oregon white oaks. Fires shocked oaks into producing mast crops of acorns, which would be preserved and used for food and trade. Today, this oak is adjacent to the sidewalk in NW Portland along a busy thoroughfare lined with shops and restaurants, still thriving in the city grew around it.",,,,
